    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Arrange chicken in a large bowl</li>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk, pickle brine, hot sauce, and egg together. 
            Pour marinade over chicken and stir, ensuring each piece is coated. 
            Cover and let chicken marinate for 2 to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>Mix flour and salt together in a shallow, flat dish. 
            Remove chicken from marinade and blot with paper towels. Reserve marinade. 
            Toss chicken in flour until thoroughly coated. Return chicken to marinade, 
            coating all sides. Remove chicken from marinade allowing excess to drip back into 
            bowl and once again coat the chicken in the flour mixture. Place on a rack. 
            Allow to sit out about 15 to allow coating to dry out.

        <li>Place butter and lard in a large pot. Add cayenne pepper, brown 
            sugar, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. Place 
            over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until fat melts. Remove from 
            heat; keep sauce warm.
        </li>
        <li>Fill cast iron skilled about 1/3 of the way with frying oil and 
            heat to 350F over medium-high heat. Carefully place chicken into 
            hot oil. Maintain an oil temperature of 325F during cooking. Fry until 
            instant read thermometer reads 160F, 8 to 10 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a rack to drain. Brush with sauce on both sides.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
